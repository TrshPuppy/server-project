# Python Web-Server

This is a web server coded in python and ~~using Flask.~~ The point of this project is to learn server and back-end development.
The details of the implementation will be purposefully complex in order for me to learn the basics. By the end, I'd like this
server to be able to withstand various forms of abuse including increased request load, malformed requests, malicious requests, etc.

## What is it serving though?

Ideally a user will be able to request a random AI image (from my personal collection) or request one based on a provided keyword. I have _thousands_ of saved
AI art pictures from my [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/trshpuppy) stream which are just sitting in storage. This will make use of those, which means I will also be learning how to organize and clean large ammounts of data.

## Technologies:

- Python
  ~~- Flask~~
- Docker (for containerization)
- Locust (for load testing)
- [Socket API](https://realpython.com/python-sockets/#multi-connection-client-and-server)

More to come!
